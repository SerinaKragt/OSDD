# COTS data-diode demonstrator

WARNING THIS IS NOT A REAL DATA-DIODE! It's just for educational purposus. <br>
<i>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, in this case it's not a duck.</i>

To be able to work with data-diodes it helps to have a cheap way of simulating a hardware data-diode. With a â‚¬25,- managed switch it's possible to create a 
data-diode for development purposes. <br>
Please note: this does not provide the same security as a real data-diode since the configuration could be modified to support bidirectional traffic or 
when the switch returns to factory defaults!

## Step 1: Buy a TP-link TL-SG105e managed switch. 
This can be done with most managed switches that support vlans and port mirroring. We choose the TP-link for the price and availablitity. <br>
Connect the switch directly to your PC and change your IP for the conencted interface manualy to 192.168.0.2. Open your browser and go to the (default) IP from the TP-link http://192.168.0.1. UserID/Password is admin/admin.<br>
If asked change the password.

## Step 2: Modify vlan per port settings
Go to the menu VLAN -> Port Based VLAN. <br>
- Enable Port Based VLAN-Configuration
- Add VLAN ID 2 and select port 1 and press apply
- Add VLAN ID 5 and select port 5 and press apply
- It's possible to assing every port their own VLAN but this is a more advanced use-case.

## Step 3: Modify port mirror
Go to the menu Monitoring -> Port Mirror
- Port Mirror: select enable, mirroring Port select Port 5
- At Mirrored Port select Port 1 (2 -3 is also possible), Ingress select enable, Egress select Disable
- Press Apply

## Step 4: Disable DHCP 
By default DHCP is enabled to provide access to the webbased management interface. We want to disable DHCP to prevent the switch asking for DHCP servers which generates traffic.<br>
This can also be abused by hackers to identify the management IP and modify the setting back to bi-directional traffic.
- Open System -> IP Setting
- IP Address Setting, DHCP setting select Disable
- You could change the IP but this is not needed.

## Step 5: Diable TP-link loop prevention
TP-Link has a feature that prevents loops in the network. This feature creates traffic and we don't want that on a data-diode. 
- Open Monitoring, Loop Prevention
- Select Disable
- Press Apply

Since we are limiting the functionality bidirectional is still possible when an attackers manges to access the web interface from the switch.<br>
