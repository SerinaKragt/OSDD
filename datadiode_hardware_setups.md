# Example data-diode hardware setups

## Basic setup

<img src="img_simple_datadiode_setup.png" width=300>

## 2 way uni-directional setup

To be able to send and receive data via separate interfaces causing a protocol break for most network attacks. This setup also provides control over the received and send data.
In this example we send an OpenSSL certificate request trough the data-diode to be signed by the CA. After signing the CA sends the signed certificate trough the second data-diode back to the sender.

## One proxy to many destinations

Since we are using one way communication it's also possible to use multiple data-diodes and destinations using a switch.

## NTP distribution to multiple stand alone networks

This example shows an example to distribute NTP to multiple networks. Note that this configuration does not support NTPv4 foley's.

## Guaranteed one way span port to IDS

In this example we prevent the IDS to connect back to the switch via the SPAN port.

## Virtual data-diode

For testing data-diode applications on one machine its possible to create a Ubuntu VM with 2 interfaces connected to separate local networks.
Using the application daemonlogger you can forward all packets from the first interface to the second.
